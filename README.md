Road Accident Analysis Dashboard - Power BI 

Iâ€™m thrilled to share my latest Power BI dashboard, which provides an in-depth analysis of road accidents based on various factors. The goal of this dashboard is to identify accident trends, high-risk areas, and contributing factors to help authorities and policymakers improve road safety.

-> Key KPIs Tracked:
 1. Total Accidents 
 2. Total Fatalities
 3. Total Injuries
 4. Accident Severity (%)
 5. Vehicle Involvement

-> Visuals & Insights:

1. Heatmap of Accident-Prone Areas
Identifies locations with the highest accident occurrences.
Helps traffic authorities focus on high-risk zones for safety improvements.

 2. Trend Analysis of Accidents Over Time
A line chart showing accident trends by year, month, and day.
Helps analyze whether accidents are increasing or decreasing over time.

 3. Accidents by Day of the Week & Time of Day
A stacked column chart visualizing accident frequency on different days.
A heatmap showing peak accident hours (morning, afternoon, evening, night).
Helps determine when accidents are most frequent.

 4. Weather Conditions Impact on Accidents
A stacked bar chart displaying accidents under different weather conditions (clear, rain, fog, snow, etc.).
Useful for understanding how weather affects road safety.

 5. Accidents by Vehicle Type Involved
A bar chart showing accident distribution across different vehicle types (cars, trucks, motorcycles, buses, etc.).
Helps identify which vehicle types are most prone to accidents.

 6. Geospatial Analysis of Accident Hotspots
A map visualization showing accident-prone regions and cities.
Useful for city planners and policymakers to enhance road safety measures.

 7. Severity of Accidents (Minor, Major, Fatal)
A donut chart categorizing accidents by severity.
Helps understand how severe accidents are in different areas.

8. Top Causes of Accidents
A bar chart highlighting common causes (speeding, drunk driving, reckless driving, poor road conditions, etc.).
Helps in policymaking and awareness campaigns to reduce accident rates.

 9. Accidents by Road Type
A stacked bar chart showing accident occurrences on highways, urban roads, rural roads, etc.
Useful for infrastructure planning and accident prevention.

10. Filters & Slicers for Detailed Analysis
Users can filter data by year, region, weather, vehicle type, accident severity, and road type to explore specific insights.
